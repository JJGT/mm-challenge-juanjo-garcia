Hi Joanna,

I'm Juanjo, one of the QA that is working over the search functionality at https://www.manomano.co.uk/. In order to be able to properly undestand the
functionality I would like to send you some questions. Here they are:

- When an user inputs one word for a search, wich kind of logic we want to apply?
- When an user inputs more than one word for a search, wich kind of logic (OR, AND) we want to apply?
- What is the minimum input length for a search?
- When showing results, do we need to follow some kind of order?
- When making a search, against wich object's parameters do we need to check that input?
- How many products per page results are we going to show to user?

Thank you for your help.

Regards,
