Taking a look to the picture I can think of:

- Unit Test to cover every piece of code. Ideally we should have a 100% line coverage with Unit Tests. This will affect to BACKEND, FRONTEND.
- E2E Tests over the most popular browsers and mobile phones (FRONTEND).
- Performance Tests over BACKEND and DB.
- Integration Tests with any THIRD PARTY we use (BACKEND).
